# Boiler plate for a blog website

This is function (but unfinished) project that can help you
create a blog with `pandoc` and `git`.

The most important feature is that the RSS feed is generated by
your git history.

This is mostly a POC, I use a similar mechanism for my own website,
and I wanted to share the basic ideas in this repo.

Any suggestions at:

 - Direct email
 - [Github Issues](https://github.com/ekiim/pandoc-git-blog/issues/new)

And I'm wrote a [blog entry](https://ekiim.xyz/blog/entries/blog-with-pandoc-and-git/)
about this POC too at my site.
